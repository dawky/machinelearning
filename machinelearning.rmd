##Summary
"In the test below, we try to quantify how well people do certain activities. We use data from 
accelerometers on the belt,forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform
barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. When fitting the model, I find the random 
forest model good for the experiment. The job I do are listed below. Information about the experiment
is available from the website here:

##Data preprocessing
#In the following parts, I loaded the data and split it into training and testing sets.
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
setwd("D:/r/coursera/machinelearning")
dtrain<-read.csv("pml-training.csv")
dtest<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
set.seed(1000)

#data split
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=dtrain$classe,p=0.7,list=F)
dtrain1<-dtrain[inTrain,]
dtest1<-dtrain[-inTrain,]

#delete unimportant factors
nzv <- nearZeroVar(dtrain1)
dtrain1 <- dtrain1[,-nzv]

nzv <- nearZeroVar(dtest1)
dtest1 <- dtest1[,-nzv]

##Delete NA
NAd<-is.na(dtrain1)
NAc<-which(colSums(NAd)/nrow(dtrain1)>0.95)
dtrain1<-dtrain1[,-NAc]
dtest1<-dtest1[,-NAc]

#delete some colomns that doesn't make sense, which is the first 5 colomns
dtrain1<-dtrain1[,-(1:5)]
dtest1<-dtest1[,-(1:5)]

##Do the 3-fold cross validation
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 3)

##Build model using the random forest(acutally I've tried the rpart, too, but the random forest model has better results)
fit<-train(classe~.,data=dtrain1,method="rf", trControl=control)
plot(fit)
fit

##Evaluation of the model and see the out-of-sample error
#see how the model fit the prediction
predt<-predict(fit,dtest1)
confusionMatrix(dtest1$classe, predt)

#the accuracy is 0.9973, high  enough, which means this is a good model

##Predict the test set
#the expected out-of-sample error is 1-0.9973=0.0027, ,apply the model to the test set 
test<-predict(fit, dtest)
test



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
